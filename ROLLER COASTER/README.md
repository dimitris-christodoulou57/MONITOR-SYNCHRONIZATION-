ROLLER COASTER

In this project we use monitors to synchronize the threads. We use a roller coaster as the problem that needed to tackle. The train starts the route only when boarded N passengers. Before start boarding the next passengers the train should complete its route and all passengers debark. Using monitors we control when passengers can board and debark and when train can start the next route.
